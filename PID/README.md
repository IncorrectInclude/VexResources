# PID


PID is becoming
mildly obsolete thanks to implementations by the Vex Team, 
but perhaps it is still useful for some use cases. So 
here's this. 

Resources: 
* [Renegade Robotics PID guide](https://renegaderobotics.org/pid-beginners-guide/) - This resource is fantastic!
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) - Way too long to read, I don't really care
* [Google Search (Gives Equation)](https://www.google.com/search?q=pid+controller) - for the more math inclined, google gives an equation.
