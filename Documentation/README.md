# Finding Documentation

Vex does not have good documentation. 
Documentation is probably
not the word for what vex gives us.
That said, there are very good
resources that can help us. 
Here's some useful links.

## References
 * [VexCode API Reference](https://api.vexcode.cloud/v5/html/)  
  This is good for looking
 up basic things, and knowing what vex
 has to offer. Methods are named weird. 
 look at the the `vex::motor::isSpinning` method
 for the most crucial example of this. I would
 say that this method is so poorly named
 that basically just using it without reading
 the documentation would lead the programmer
 to either a) assume that they have a bug, or
 b) that vexcode has a bug, when, in reality,
 neither is the case, the method just doesn't
 do what the name says it does. 
 * [Pearman Documentation Post](https://www.vexforum.com/t/vexcode-motor-groups-and-drivetrain-example/69161)   
 This basically fills in the missing imformation
 on `vex::motor_group`, `vex::drivetrain`, and `vex::smartdrive`. This resource is priceless for 
 the lacking documentation on the API reference. 
 READ BEFORE EVEN THINKING OF MAKING AN AUTONOMOUS.
